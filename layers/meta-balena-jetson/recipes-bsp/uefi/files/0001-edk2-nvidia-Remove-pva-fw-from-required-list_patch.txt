Subject: [PATCH] edk2-nvidia: Remove pva-fw from required list

This allows us to apply back the L4T 35.5.0
capsule during rollback health. Without this patch,
the 36.3 firmware will fail to apply the old 35.5.0
UEFI capsule because the old release did not
include this firmware in any QSPI partition.

Upstream-status: Inappropriate [configuration]
